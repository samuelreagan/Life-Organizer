# Life-Organizer
I created this project for my Database Systems class in the Fall of 2018. I designed a web application to organize a user's life. They can track their daily tasks, habits, goals and notes. When user's complete tasks, goals, or habits they earn experience points that enable them to level up.

I completed this project using Bootstrap for the front-end interface, PHP for the back-end programming, and PL/SQL for the database.
